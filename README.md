# GoatApp
## Overview
GoatApp is a web app meant to help students on campus be able to navigate as well as coordinate events using posts and a map.
This is a redo of the original since there were many issues that came from scrimblo coding. This is in hopes of 
getting the project off of its knees and going back up once again.

## Changes
GoatApp is planning some changes to help reflect a better tech stack as well as help us understand how to use these stacks.
### Backend
Our Node.js backend was pretty straightforward, but we can probably do better than that. We can stick with it for now, but
there are other options like KTor and Flask. Node is pretty slow and I really don't like JS but at the same time we 
need a backend that can be hosted and deployed on Azure. So far, there are no straightforward KTor tutorials on hosting 
it yet.
