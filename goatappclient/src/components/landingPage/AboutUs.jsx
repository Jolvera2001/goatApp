                <p className='lorusAbout'>GOat Places wants to make your campus experience one to remember.
                 We have created a space for students to not only view current events but also easily find their
                  classes through our interactive map. You can follow your fellow classmates and staff and check 
                  out what events they post about. You can also share your locations with your friends and people 
                  you follow, and if that's getting a little too personal then you can switch it right off! 
                  Join the GOat Places community and discover your campus. </p>
